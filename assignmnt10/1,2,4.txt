1. Higher order function and Call back function are not same.

		Higher order function 			Call back function
	
	 
	HOF is a function that takes one or 		CBF is a fucntion that is passed into
	more fucntions as arguments or 			a function as an argument, then 
	returns a function as its itself.		invoked inside the outer function to
							complete some action.

	Map,Filter,Reduce are the examples of		Primary purpose is to execute code in
	HOF.						response to an event.


	HOF is the function that takes call back	CBF is the function that passed as an	 
	function as a argument.				argument inside Higher order function.		





2. Filter is a Higher order function. Filter used to take in argument and return a filtered
   value based on a certain condition. It also takes call back function as argument and
   returns an new array with only values that meet certain criteria. It return value which 
   can be used as an argument also but not neccessarily should be used as arugument to 
   any fucntion unlike call back function which is compulsory need to execute.


4 a) Line 4 has an error.Fixing error by 


		fn(arr[I]);  ===>  fn(arr(i));  


		Output:

		Hello John
		Hello Tina
		Hello Kale
		Hello Max


 b) usefunction() is the Higher order function as its takes argFn another fucntion as an 
    argument.
