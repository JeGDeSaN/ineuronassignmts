1.			Generator				Functions


	Generator can stop its execution midway			cannot be stopped between execution
	and continue their execution from some			which is designed to perform a 
	point.							particular task.


	Yield statement passes the execution of			Functions are self invoked and used for
	a generator and returns a value.			reuseing the code multifle times.

	
	Generators are memory efficient as it			Functions have only one return statement
	can be yield whenever its needed.			and returns value. 



2.	Syntax:

		function* generatorFunction()	{

				yield value1;
				yield value2;

						}


3. 	Function Generators are iterable.

	Generator function are used to create custom iterators.

	An iterator is a object that implements the iterator protocol,which requires the presence of next() method that returns 
	an object with the property value.
