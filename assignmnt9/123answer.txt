	Describes the context of the variable		refers the ability of function
	access.						to remember and access lexical
							scope.

	Variable has limited lifetime.			Variable can persist beyond the 
							lifetime of function.

	Variable within a scope are accessible		Closure allow access to variable

							even after that function has exited.




3.	Lexical scope is the ability for a function scope to access variable from the parent 
	scope.It defines the scope of a variable by the position of that variable declared in
	the source code. 
	
	It is related to closure as it enables a fucntion to access  variable even after its
